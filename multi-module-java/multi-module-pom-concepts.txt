Why we need multi module projects/POM
a. We can keep all the common functionaloitiues/features of project into super and that can help in reusability

Since child projects will take inherit featurs from super pom we get below benefits
a. we can manage properties tag things onn super hence we can mangage dependency versions at one place. child will just inherit it
b. plugin can be kept in super and hence plugin code tags will be kept at only one place hence saving code duplication
c. repostiories can be shared as well
